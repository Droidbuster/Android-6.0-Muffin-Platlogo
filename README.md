#Droidbuster XDA Android 6.0 Muffin Platlogo


Hola friends! How's you? 
Today I am proudly sharing my work!
Want to Know What is it?
I already know that you already know that it's a Platlogo of Android 6.0 from the title!'
I know you are wondering why is it android 6.0 even when Google hasn't released it.
To be more clear, we all know that Google has recently released android M, and it's in beta stage. So unofficially we may call that Android 6.0!

The main element of Android OS is, its Platlogo.
All of us are waiting eagerly to see what google has to unleash in the next android version.
Honestly saying, I want the name of the version to be Android Muffin grin emoticon

Hence I worked on Android  6.0 Muffin Platlogo by empowering my own Imagination.
Thus, Developers can use it in their  upcoming ROMS.
I built the logo from scratch.
Therefore it will also work on Android Gingerbread powered devices too! 
I think Gingerbread developers will also be happy now! grin emoticon
Today I am attaching its sample application. 
So everyone can try and give their review about it on Playstore.
Yes!! This will be my first app that will go live on Play Store!
There are two themes in this app.
Give them a try and do review it for me.
I worked for days and nights to make this app work perfect. 
SO, I am excited for it too!
